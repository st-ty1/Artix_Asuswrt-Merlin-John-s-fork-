all modifications are located in src/router/Makefile file:

1. remove in targets libmnl/stamp-h1, libnfnetlink/stamp-h1, pptpd/stamp-h1 and ipset_arm/stamp-h1 (ipset_arm/stamp-h1
   only needed for ARM-builds):
		" STRIP=$(STRIP) "
	
2. insert at end of target libmnl the following line (only needed with ARM-builds and if ipset is installed in host system):
		" @rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libmnl.la "
		
3. add these two additional -D arguments to cmake command getdns/build/Makefile-target:
 		" -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \  "
		  
4. add " &&./buildconf " in target curl/Makefile (otherwise building process of mips arch will crash) 
   i.e. change  line "@cd curl && CC=$(CC) \" to "@cd curl && ./buildconf && CC=$(CC) \"
   
5. for colored output change SEP=echo "\033[41;1m   $@   \033[0m" into SEP=printf "\033[41;1m   $@   \033[0m" 
   as bash shell is used on Artix instead of Dash shell on Ubuntu/Debian.
