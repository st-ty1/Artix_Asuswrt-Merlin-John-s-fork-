 release/src/router/Makefile has to be modified as follows:

1. replace in targets libnfnetlink/stamp-h1 and pptpd/stamp-h1: (nneded by mips)
		" STRIP=$(STRIP) " by "STRIP=$(CROSS_COMPILE)strip"
	
2. insert at end of target libmnl the following line (only needed with ARM-builds and if ipset is installed in host system):
		" @rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libmnl.la "
		
3. add these two additional -D arguments to cmake command getdns/build/Makefile-target:
 		" -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-FAILED_TO_RUN" \
		  -DSTRPTIME_WORKS_EXITCODE__TRYRUN_OUTPUT="PLEASE_FILL_OUT-NOTFOUND" -Hforce \  "
		  
4. add " &&./buildconf " in target curl/Makefile (otherwise building process of mips will crash) 
   i.e. change  line "@cd curl && CC=$(CC) \" to "@cd curl && ./buildconf && CC=$(CC) \"
   
5. for colored output change SEP=echo "\033[41;1m   $@   \033[0m" into SEP=printf "\033[41;1m   $@   \033[0m" 
   as bash shell is used on Artix instead of Dash shell on Ubuntu/Debian.
       
6. insert at end of target libdaemon the following line:
		" @rm -f libmnl/staged/usr/lib/libdaemon.la "
		
7. add to LDFLAGS of target openpam/Makefile the following options: (needed for arm)
	"-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/arm-brcm-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/usr/lib -L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib"
   The former option "-ldl" is not needed.
   
 8. at target ipset-7/stamp-h1: (needed for arm)
 	- change flag libml_CFLAGS to "-I$(TOP)/libmnl-1.0.4/include" and flag libmnl_LIBS to "-L$(TOP)/libmnl-1.0.4/src/.libs -lmnl"
        - and add to LDFLAGS "-L$(TOOLCHAIN)/arm-brcm-linux-uclibcgnueabi/sysroot/usr/lib -L$(TOOLCHAIN)/lib" (-> similar to 7. openpam)
	
 9. add " autoreconf -fsi && \" in target libxml2/stamp-h1:
    i.e. change line   "cd libxml2 && \"   to   "cd libxml2 && autoreconf -fsi && \"
 
 10. add "-std=gnu99" at CFLAGS of targets radvd/stamp-h1 and nano/Makefile
